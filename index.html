        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The basic idea of this project is to create a Name Server that responds to the queries from
Global DNS servers like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8) with respecting the geography
of the IP Address it is requested from.</p>

<p>It does look difficult from the perspective of normal website user, but if you think about it from a
engineering perspective it is quite simple.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this project is to have a Name server that sits in-between DNS and records.
    Based on the location it will resolve A/AAAA records closest to the Client IP that requested the record.

    e.g. if client is in India and the website they visit is resolving to multiple IPs around the globe
    thatdns service will respond with only nearest ones.
</p>

<h2>How it works?</h2>
<h3>DNS Infrastructure overview</h3>

<p>From the figure above we can see the DNS Providers have servers
    distributed around the globe and to access any Domain the first
    step is to get the NS record (not shown in the diagram) for the domain.
