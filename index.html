<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The basic idea of this project (or a PoC) is to create a Name Server that responds to the queries from
    Global DNS servers like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8) with respecting the geography
    of the IP Address it is requested from.
</p>

<p>
    It does look difficult from the perspective of normal website user, but if you think about it from a
    engineering perspective it is quite simple.
</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>
    The main purpose of this project is to have a Name server that sits in-between DNS and records.
    Based on the location it will resolve A/AAAA records closest to the Client IP that requested the record.
</p>
<p>
    e.g. if client is in India and the website they visit is resolving to multiple IPs around the globe
    thatdns service will respond with only nearest ones.
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2>

<p>
    The server is running CoreDNS service that responds to all the queries from DNS Servers.
    Following are the plugins that are going to be used.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>file: File plugin allows serving records from a File.</li>
    <li>geoip: Allows to set metadata about the Client IP.</li>
    <li>geodns: Allows resolving the record and if it has more than one A record, check closest one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Plugin</h3>
<p>
    The simple file has records which needs records to be served. More details about it are
    available in <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/file/">Core DNS Plugin file</a>
</p>

<h3>GeoIP Plugin</h3>
<p>
    The GeoIP plugin allows adding a metadata about the Client Address, like Country, City, etc.
    More details about it are available in
    <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/geoip/">Core DNS Plugin geoip</a>
</p>

<h3>GeoDNS Plugin (In progress)</h3>
<p>
    This plugin is in development, it actually does the magic.
    It is a middleware which filters the IPs which are nearby to the Client IP.
    Code repository is available at <a href="https://git.dcpri.me/that-organization/geodns">GeoDNS Git Repository</a>.
